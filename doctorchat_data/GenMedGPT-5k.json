Additionally, we need to take a blood test to check if there is anemia or if you have abnormal blood clotting. A complete blood count is necessary to look into your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. An electrocardiogram will also be conducted to evaluate your heart's health, as this may have caused the hemorrhage in the first place. Finally, we need to monitor your fluid intake.

Moexipril is good to control high blood pressure that you may experience due to medication side-effects, and Desflurane will be used during any surgery or procedure you may have to control pain."
